## VGG Image Annotator (VIA)

Version: [3.0.11](https://gitlab.com/vgg/via/blob/master/CHANGELOG)

VGG Image Annotator (VIA) is a simple and standalone manual annotation tool for image,
    audio and video. The VIA software is a light weight, standalone and offline software
    package that does not require any installation or setup and runs solely in a web
    browser. The complete VIA software fits in a single self-contained HTML page of size
    less than 500 kilobyte that runs as an offline application in most modern web
    browsers. VIA software is an open source project created solely using HTML,
    Javascript and CSS. More details about VIA is available from
    <http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via>.

### Open Source Ecosystem

We have nurtured a large and thriving open source community which not only provides
    feedback but also contributes code to add new features and improve existing features
    in the VIA software. The open source ecosystem of VIA thrives around its [source
    code repository](https://gitlab.com/vgg/via) hosted by the Gitlab platform. Most of
    our users report issues and request new features for future releases using the
    [issue portal](https://gitlab.com/vgg/via/issues). Many of our users not only submit
    bug reports but also suggest a potential fix for these software issues. Some of our
    users also contribute code to add new features to the VIA software using the [merge
    request](https://gitlab.com/vgg/via/merge_requests) portal. A list of our
    contributors is available
    [here](https://gitlab.com/vgg/via/blob/master/Contributors.md).

Thanks to the flexibility provided by our BSD open source software
    [license](https://gitlab.com/vgg/via/blob/master/LICENSE), many industrial projects
    have adapted the VIA software for internal or commercial use.
